### Rootless Containers 

![container image ](https://www.atatus.com/blog/content/images/size/w960/2024/04/Docker-Clean-up-1.png)

Container technology allows developers to break down application tiers (like the backend) into smaller microservices. Since containers share the host OS kernel and use fewer resources than VMs, a single host can run many containers efficiently. However, this density increases risk ‚Äî compromising one container could affect the entire host. To reduce this risk, developers follow the principle of least privilege to limit access and minimize attack surfaces.


#### Analyzing Rootless Containers
Rootless containers, or unprivileged containers, are containers that do not require administrator privileges.

**A container is rootless only when it meets the following conditions:**

- The containerized process does not use the root user, which is a special privileged user in Linux and UNIX systems. Such a user is for administrative purposes and has the ID 0.

- The root user inside of the container is not the root user outside of the container.

- The container runtime does not use the root user. For example, if your container runtime runs as the root user, then containers managed by such runtime are not rootless containers.




####  **Rootful vs Rootless Containers**

| Feature      | **Rootful**                                 | **Rootless**                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Runs As      | **Root user**                               | **Non-root user**                       |
| Security     | Higher risk (has full system access)        | Safer (no root privileges on host)      |
| Setup        | Default setup (needs sudo)                  | Requires user namespaces & config       |
| Port Binding | Can bind to **<1024** ports (e.g., 80, 443) | Can only bind to **high ports** (>1024) |
| Storage      | `/var/lib/containers`                       | `$HOME/.local/share/containers`         |
| Use Cases    | System-wide services, legacy tools          | Dev/test environments, CI/CD pipelines  |



### üîê Key Differences

* Rootful = More powerful, more dangerous
* Rootless = More secure, but limited capabilities



### ‚úÖ Commands 

* Use `podman` as non-root for **rootless containers**:

  ```bash
  podman run -it nginx
  ```

* For **rootful**:

  ```bash
  sudo podman run -it nginx
  ```

* Use `podman info` to verify rootless vs rootful:

  ```bash
  podman info | grep -i rootless
  ```

### Example 


#### üß™ **Hands-On: Run Rootless Podman NGINX with SELinux Volume**

#####  1. **Enable and Start Podman Service**


```bash
systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
systemctl --user status podman.socket
```

> üìå For **rootless**, use `--user` with `systemctl`.

<br>

#####  2. **Create a New User**

```bash
sudo useradd strangerthings
sudo passwd strangerthings
```

> üîë Set any password you prefer when prompted.

<br>

##### 3. **Login as the New User**

```bash
su - strangerthings
```

<br>

#####  4. **Create a Directory for Website Content**

```bash
mkdir ~/nginx-data
```

<br>

#####  5. **Fix Permissions (chown inside user namespace)**

```bash
podman unshare chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) ~/nginx-data
```

> This ensures the container can access the directory in rootless mode.

<br>

#####  6. **Create a Sample HTML Page**

```bash
echo "Welcome to the upside-down!" > ~/nginx-data/index.html
```

<br>

#####  7. **Check SELinux Status**

```bash
sestatus
```

> Ensure SELinux is `enforcing`. If it's disabled, skip the `:z` step.

<br>

#####  8. **Run NGINX Container with Volume Mount**

```bash
podman run -d \
  -p 9000:80 \
  -v ~/nginx-data:/usr/share/nginx/html:Z \
  nginx
```

> üîÅ `:Z` applies a **private SELinux label** so NGINX can access the volume.

<br>

#####  9. **Verify It‚Äôs Working**

```bash
curl http://localhost:9000
```

> You should see: `Welcome to the upside-down!`

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è Bonus: SELinux Label Check (Optional)

```bash
ls -Z ~/nginx-data
```

If SELinux blocks access, manually add context:

```bash
sudo semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t '/home/strangerthings/nginx-data(/.*)?'
sudo restorecon -Rv ~/nginx-data
```
